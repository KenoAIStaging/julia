  subtyping predicate

  Uses the algorithm described in section 4.2.2 of https://github.com/JeffBezanson/phdthesis/
  This code adds the following features to the core algorithm:

  - Type variables can be restricted to range over only concrete types.
    This is done by returning false if such a variable's lower bound is not concrete.
  - Diagonal rule: a type variable is concrete if it occurs more than once in
    covariant position, and never in invariant position. This sounds like a syntactic
    property, but actually isn't since it depends on which occurrences of a type
    variable the algorithm actually uses.
  - Unconstrained type vars (Bottom<:T<:Any) can match non-type values.
  - Vararg types have an int-valued length parameter N (in `Vararg{T,N}`).
  - Type{T}<:S if isa(T,S). Existing code assumes this, but it's not strictly
    correct since a type can equal `T` without having the same representation.
  - Free type variables are tolerated. This can hopefully be removed after a
    deprecation period.

//
// `Type{T}` denotes every type `U` with `U == T` (mutual subtyping), lifted
// into the type domain, so `Type{T} <: S` iff `isa(U, S)` for every such `U`
// (#33136, #62141). Distinct representatives of the same `==`-class generally
// carry different type tags: `Tuple{S} where S<:Int == Tuple{Int}` is a
// `UnionAll`, `Union{Tuple{Int},Tuple{String}} == Tuple{Union{Int,String}}` is
// a `Union`, and bound-pinned spellings like `Vector{S} where Int<:S<:Int`
// exist for every class (whether a particular constructor normalizes them away
// is incidental, so we treat `UnionAll` representatives as present in every
// class). `typeeq_kind_mask` computes a superset of the type tags of the
// members of `T`'s `==`-class; `Type{T} <: y` then requires every kind in the
// mask to be a subtype of `y`.
//
// The one exemption is `Union{}` itself: the runtime globally normalizes every
// spelling of the empty bottom type to the unique bottom object (`Tuple` types
// with `Union{}` parameters collapse, `T where T<:S` returns its bound, union
// components absorb), so `{U : U == Union{}}` is `{Union{}}` exactly and
// `Type{Union{}} == TypeofBottom` remains true. Consequently `TypeofBottom`
// and `Type{Union{}}` are two spellings of one class, and each one's tag
// appears in the mask of the other.
//
// The mask over-approximates: a spurious kind only makes `Type{T} <: y`
// (soundly) fail more often. For exotic spellings this can reject subtypings
// that hold for the canonical spelling of the same class; subtyping was
// already incomplete for such spellings.
